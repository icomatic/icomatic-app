Icon font generation prototype, still in the very early stages

## Demo

To view the demo, download the source and open app/index.html.
At the upload stage, use the files under test-files.

## Notes

The demo currently only supports svgs containing non-transformed paths (eg, you can't
have paths in scaled groups). The exported font uses a ligature, the filename, and
exports an svg font alongside the css required to use it.
